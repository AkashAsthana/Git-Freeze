Welcome to Git Freeze! Each week we will be providing you with a small project idea or let’s say a real life problem statement along with an extensive list of resources that'll help you gain the skills required for the project. You will have one week to learn the relevant technologies and solve the problem. Make sure you read and follow the [coding instructions](./CODING_INSTRUCTIONS.md). If you have any doubts, you can reach out to us anytime on [discord](https://discord.gg/Qxz2A5s). Let's get to some specifics.

## First Steps

- You'll have to use [Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhtzxPU7Bz0) & [Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E) for [version control](https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control). Here are some resources to get you started:
    - [Code School's tryGit](https://try.github.io/)
    - [TheNewBoston's Git Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAKWClAD_iKpNC0bGHxGhcx)
    - [Github's Github Learning Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S0p8YMQzsM)
    - [Udacity's Git & Github Course](https://in.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)
    - [Udacity's Github Collaboration Course](https://in.udacity.com/course/github-collaboration--ud456)
    - [Learn Git Branching - An interactive way to learn Git](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?demo)

- Make your github account (if you don’t already have one). Avail [github student pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to get amazing student benefits like free services & private repositories. You may use college email-id or semester registration card to avail it. This process generally takes 24 - 48 hours for approval. (Although student pack isn't **required** for participating in Git Freeze, we highly recommend claiming it. After all, it's free!)

## Attempting Problems

On your local machine, prepare the solution in a new folder. Here enable and use git to keep track of your files. Once your solution is prepared do the following:

- Fork this repository.
- Clone your forked repo on your local machine.
- Create a new branch with the following format: `<github-username>/week<num>`, e.g.: `yashodeep/week1`
- Create a directory in the respective week's directory with your github username as the name of the directory.
- Code your solution in that directory only.
- Create a README.md file. It must contain the following:
    - How to run? This is very important as we all use different tools so provide a brief description as to how you ran your code in your machine while preparing the solution.
    - Softwares / Tools used while making the project.
    - What your project does? Describe each and every feature (more or less) of your project.
- Once you feel you have fulfilled the basic requirements, push your code to github and create a pull request.
- After the specified time period, you will be evaluated on the basis of project execution, code quality, ideas and many more parameters.

## General Tips

- A wise guy has said *Conventions Maketh Coder*. So, ensure that you follow coding standards. This makes your code readable and understandable for others **as well as you** at a later point. You can use vigilance as well as editor/ide extensions to assist in this. Here are some coding standards for some popular languages:
    - [Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
    - [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp)
    - [C++](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
    - [Java](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)

## Results & Prizes

- Every week, we will select the best attempt at solving the problem. Their code will be added here at the end of the event.
- If you get featured on a problem, you stand to win prizes and more !!
